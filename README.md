# SimpleJournal
Simple Journal is a simple Windows application that allows you to create a locally stored journal.  The file format is simple -- RTF files stored within an encrypted zip files -- so you do not need the client installed to be able to read or write entries.

For more information on the motivation behind Simple Journal, please see:
